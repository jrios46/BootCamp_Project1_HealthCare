# Topic: Understanding Demographic Disparities in COVID-19 Vaccination Compliance: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Overview
    This repository contains the code and analysis conducted on factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake. The analysis explores demographic, socio-political, and regional variables to understand patterns in vaccination behavior among survey respondents.

    Present code is divided in #''NUMBER' 
    
    Part 1:  Translates the csv file to be the main object of analysis.
    
    Part 2: Part filter the data to determine variables that matter the most to take the decision to take a vaccine

    Part 3: Plotting the selected variables 

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis comprises responses from a survey conducted to assess individuals' attitudes and behaviors regarding COVID-19 vaccination. It includes information on demographics (such as age, gender, race), socio-political factors (such as political affiliation, religion), and vaccination status.

## Analysis
The analysis involves several steps:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was cleaned and organized to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.

Exploration of Factors: Demographic and socio-political factors were explored to identify patterns and correlations with vaccination status.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests such as chi-square tests were conducted to examine the relationships between variables.

Visualization: Visualizations, including bar charts and contingency tables, were created to illustrate the findings.

## Findings
-Political affiliation did not significantly influence vaccination status.
-Gender disparities were observed, with a higher proportion of females reporting vaccination compared to males.
-Higher levels of education were associated with higher vaccination rates.
-Variations in vaccination rates were observed among different religious groups.
-Disparities in vaccine uptake were observed across states and racial groups.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights that can inform targeted public health interventions, vaccination campaigns, and policy initiatives aimed at promoting equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and increasing vaccination rates across diverse populations.
